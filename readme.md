# Visual Acuity Tester using Optokinetic Nystagmus

*By Shivan Sivakumaran*

We are going to use Python to create a moving, repeating stimulus across a minitor to induce Optokinetic Nystagmus.

## To-do
- [X] Use `pygame` to create optotype and move it across monitor
- [ ] Use OpenCV to detect eye and movement for OKN

## Required modules

- pygame - generates screen
- opencv-python*

*You can see there is alot more code here than intended. This is because I will come back to this project (at some time) and look at introducing pupil detection to tract the 'amount' of OKN present. But this is for the furture, so sorry for the mess.

## Important files

- `main.py` - contains the main code
- `requirements.txt` - contains the non standard libraries for python

## More information

I've written a short blog post on this. [Please do check it out](https://shivansivakumaran.com/how-i-used-python-to-induce-optokinetic-nystagmus).
